# Popskill frontend

Custom competitive skill rating system for CS:GO, based on [TrueSkill](https://trueskill.org/), integrated with [Popflash](https://popflash.site/) games. This is used to track the skill of University of Cambridge players across internal matches, much like an ELO system.

This repo contains all the front-end website code.
