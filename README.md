# Popskill frontend

Custom competitive skill rating system for CS:GO, based on [TrueSkill](https://trueskill.org/), integrated with [Popflash](https://popflash.site/) games. This is used to track the skill of University of Cambridge players across internal matches, much like an ELO system.

This repo contains the frontend, available [here](https://pop.robey.xyz).

You can view the code for the backend rating, API and discord code [here](https://github.com/mxbi/popskill/).

Credit goes to [@mxbi](https://github.com/mxbi) for being the brains behind the project, and [@theo-brown](https://github.com/theo-brown) and [@speedstyle](https://github.com/speedstyle) for their help with the backend.
